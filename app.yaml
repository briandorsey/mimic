  script: mimic.app
  # This script handler must either not require login, or require admin login
  # (via 'login: admin'). Do not specify 'login: required' since offline
  # requests (Cron, Task Queue, etc.) will fail with this error:
  #   Request failed because URL requires user login. For requests invoked
  #   within App Engine (offline requests like Task Queue, or webhooks like XMPP
  #   and Incoming Mail), the URL must require admin login (or no login)
